# Ultra-Zen Native Sovereignty Philosophy
# "The mountain does not teach the river how to flow"

native_sovereignty:
  principle: |
    Each tool is master of its domain. We import universal semantics (hjkl, /, ESC)
    while honoring native innovations. Like water, we take the container's shape
    while maintaining our essence.

  domains:
    helix:
      sovereignty: "Text editing and navigation semantics"
      we_import: ["gh/gl for line nav", "ge for end", "x for extend selection"]
      we_honor: "The art of semantic modal editing"

    fish:
      sovereignty: "Shell completions and command construction"
      we_import: ["vi modes", "/ for search", "hjkl + w/b/e for ALL navigation"]
      we_honor: ["Tab for completion", "Ctrl+F tradition"]
      we_reject: ["Alt+arrows - Helix navigation is superior"]

    niri:
      sovereignty: "Window management and spatial organization"
      we_import: ["hjkl for focus", "universal dismissal with q"]
      we_honor: "System-wide window manipulation patterns"

    alacritty:
      sovereignty: "Terminal emulation and system clipboard"
      we_import: ["vi mode", "Helix navigation"]
      we_honor: ["Ctrl+Shift+C/V for clipboard", "terminal conventions"]

refinements_from_testing:
  fish_shell:
    # Buffer navigation (gg/ge) removed - not useful in shell context
    removed:
      - action: file_start
        reason: "Jumping to first ever command not useful in shell"
      - action: file_end
        reason: "Jumping to last command not useful in shell"

    # Selection modes kept for Helix consistency
    preserved:
      - action: extend_selection (x)
        reason: "Maintain Helix muscle memory even if similar to v"
      - action: visual_mode (v)
        reason: "Standard vi visual mode"

    # Native Fish autosuggestions honored
    native_keys:
      Tab: "Primary completion - universal"
      Ctrl+F: "Fish tradition - respect existing muscle memory"
      Alt+Right: "Accept next word - Fish innovation"
      Alt+Left: "Move back word - natural pairing"
      # Note: We don't override these with semantic templates

wisdom_gained:
  - "Not all editor navigation makes sense in a shell"
  - "Honor the local language while maintaining your accent"
  - "Native tools know their domain best"
  - "Consistency matters where it helps, not where it hinders"
  - "The Middle Way: universal semantics + native sovereignty"
