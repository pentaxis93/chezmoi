# Example: SSH Private Key from Bitwarden
#
# This is an EXAMPLE file showing how to retrieve an SSH private key from Bitwarden.
# To use:
# 1. Store your SSH private key in Bitwarden as a Secure Note named "ssh-private-key"
# 2. Rename this file from 'private_id_rsa.tmpl.example' to 'private_id_rsa.tmpl'
# 3. Run 'chezmoi apply' to retrieve and place the key
#
# The 'private_' prefix ensures the file has 0600 permissions (read/write for owner only)
# Perfect for SSH keys which require strict permissions
