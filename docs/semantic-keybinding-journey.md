# Semantic Keybinding Implementation Journey

## The Vision Realized

We have successfully implemented the foundation of our semantic keybinding template system - a single source of truth for keybinding intentions that manifest contextually across applications.

## Lessons Learned - Jewels of Wisdom

### 1. Template Function Discovery
**Challenge**: Initial attempt used `include` function which doesn't exist in chezmoi templates.
**Wisdom**: Chezmoi uses `template` function directly to output template content. Cannot capture output in variables; must output directly.
**Resolution**: Use `{{ template "name.tmpl" dict }}` directly in output position.

### 2. Context Passing Complexity
**Challenge**: Nested template calls cannot access parent context via `$.`
**Wisdom**: Each template invocation creates isolated context. Must explicitly pass all needed data.
**Resolution**: Pass `keybindings` data explicitly in dict to each template.

### 3. Optional Parameters in Templates
**Challenge**: `| default` doesn't work for missing keys in dicts, causing template errors.
**Wisdom**: Go template's `default` only works for existing keys with nil/empty values, not missing keys.
**Resolution**: Use `hasKey` function to check existence before accessing optional parameters.

### 4. Data Structure Hierarchy
**Challenge**: Initial keybindings.yaml lacked top-level key, making data inaccessible.
**Wisdom**: Chezmoi loads YAML files with their top-level key as namespace in template data.
**Resolution**: Wrapped all content under `keybindings:` key to match `kanagawa:` pattern.

### 5. YAML Indentation Precision
**Challenge**: Restructuring YAML broke indentation, causing parse errors.
**Wisdom**: YAML is whitespace-sensitive; automated edits must preserve exact indentation.
**Resolution**: Careful manual correction of indentation levels for nested structures.

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ Semantic keybinding definitions in `keybindings.yaml`
- ✅ Template fragments for each semantic category
- ✅ Format converter template for different config syntaxes
- ✅ Niri window manager using semantic templates
- ✅ Successfully tested template expansion

### Discoveries During Implementation
- **No Conflicts Yet**: Niri's keybindings mapped cleanly to semantic system
- **Flexibility Works**: Optional modifier parameter allows context-specific overrides
- **Consistency Achieved**: Same semantic action produces appropriate keys per context

## The Way Forward

### Next Steps (Pending Tasks)
1. **Fish Shell Integration**: Apply semantic templates to vi mode keybindings
2. **Alacritty Terminal**: Template vi mode and system keybindings
3. **Conflict Documentation**: Create `keybind-conflicts.yaml` as we discover them
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Terminal apps, modal editors, system shortcuts

### Anticipated Challenges
- **Modal Context Switching**: Vi modes in Fish/Alacritty may need mode-aware templates
- **System Key Conflicts**: Media keys, function keys may clash with WM
- **Terminal Escape Sequences**: Some key combinations may not translate cleanly

## Philosophical Insights

### "The river shapes the stone, and the stone shapes the river"
Our semantic system is shaping how we think about keybindings, while the reality of different applications shapes our semantic definitions. Each conflict we encounter teaches us about the boundaries between contexts.

### The Master's Wisdom Proven
"Do not define keybindings; define intentions" - This approach has already shown its power. Changing a semantic keybinding in one place will update it everywhere, maintaining consistency while allowing context-specific manifestations.

### Template Debugging Zen
Each error was a teacher:
- Missing functions taught us about chezmoi's template engine
- Context errors taught us about data flow
- Indentation errors taught us about precision

## Technical Architecture

### Template Hierarchy
```
keybindings.yaml          # Single source of truth
    ├── keybind-nav.tmpl      # Navigation intention → key mapping
    ├── keybind-manipulate.tmpl # Manipulation intention → key mapping
    ├── keybind-invoke.tmpl    # Invocation intention → key mapping
    ├── keybind-transform.tmpl # Transformation intention → key mapping
    ├── keybind-dismiss.tmpl   # Dismissal intention → key mapping
    └── keybind-format.tmpl    # Syntax-specific formatting
```

### Data Flow
1. `keybindings.yaml` loaded by chezmoi as `.keybindings`
2. Config templates access via `$kb := .keybindings`
3. Semantic templates receive `keybindings` in dict
4. Templates output context-appropriate key combinations
5. Config files receive properly formatted keybindings

## Ultra-Zen Achievement

We have created a system where:
- **Intentions are primary**: We think in terms of what we want to do, not which keys to press
- **Context is respected**: Each application manifests intentions appropriately
- **Change is centralized**: One modification updates all contexts
- **Conflicts are opportunities**: Each edge case deepens our understanding

The semantic keybinding system is not just a technical solution - it's a philosophy of interaction made manifest in code.
